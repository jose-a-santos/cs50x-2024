Ciencia da computação é resolver problemas

Solving ploblems is simples like that:
	Input -> Transformation -> Output


Computer language	
	base-2-binary
		0 and 1
		1 = bit / binary digity = on
		0 = bit = off

base-10
100 10 1

base-2
4 2 1

001 = 1
010 = 2
011 = 3
100 = 4
101 = 5
111 = 6

00000001 = 8bit = bite, ascii = 256 = 8bit, unicode = 4bilion = 32bit
	
	Unicode's mission is to represent and preserve digitally all of humanity's languages.
